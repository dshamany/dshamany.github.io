    <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>As a child, I fell in love with computers. It was the first time I had seen one, and she was an IBM box running Windows 3.1 where the password was entered in the command prompt.</p>
        <p>As I got older, Windows went 95 and I went Mac. Occassionally I would flirt with Linux, but Linux was a bit immature and mocked by others. As Linux matured, we met again. This time Linux was wearing a Fedora. We flirted back and forth while I was with Mac. Eventually Mac was cheated on severeal times until 2017 when we comletely broke up.</p>
        <p>Ever since, I have been with Linux, in an open relationship that allows me to use HTML, CSS, JS, C++, Python, and even Swift. Since then I have also learned to use MongoDB, NodeJS, React and React Native. I have flirted with Dart, and extensively used Bash. With Linux under my belt, I now understand the benfits and shortcommings of both Windows and Mac.</p> 
        <p>My extensive use of VIM on the server-side is coupled with Python and Bash scripting. I've SSHed onto an AWS server, built backend CRM services, developed an iOS app (on a Mac) using Swift, and provided fullstack solutions.</p>
        <p>As a freelancer, I have built several solutions for smaller companies on smaller budgets and saved tons of resources and money. The reason you should contact me is my tenacity, ambition, and the need to deliver on time and on point.</p>
