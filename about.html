    <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>As a child, I fell in love with computers. It was the first time I had seen one, and she was an IBM box running Windows 3.1 where the password was entered in the command prompt.</p>
        <p>As I got older, Windows went 95 and I went Mac. Occassionally I would flirt with Linux, but Linux was a bit immature and mocked by others. As Linux matured, we met again. This time Linux was wearing a Fedora. We flirted back and forth while I was with Mac. Eventually Mac was cheated on severeal times until 2017 when we comletely broke up.</p>
        <p>Ever since, I have been with Linux, in an open relationship that allows me to use HTML, CSS, JS, C++, Python, and even Swift. Since then I hav also learned to use MongoDB, NodeJS, React and React Native. I have flirted with Dart, and extensively used Bash. With Linux under my belt, I now understand the benfits and shortcommings of both Windows and Mac.</p> 
        <p>What a relief.</p>
